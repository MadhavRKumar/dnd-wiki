# Redorath

An editable wiki for our DnD campaign.  Redorath was created to help us keep track of the characters, locations, and everything else we create during our campaign.  As a wiki it is designed to be worked on collaboratively.  I created this to practice developing a full-stack application with CI/CD.  I continually revisit this project to work on my refactoring and software architecture skills.
